# Lab3 (Lab4)


### Main problems:
 - Autolayout is still a pain, but much less painfull as it was before.
 - Tried to do some screens as scroll view to display them on any other orientation, but failed.
 - It would be cool if you gave a quick brief course through scroll views and how to handle horizontal orientation
 - The same with delegates, callbacks, segues, used unwind segue to pass data from AddMovieVC to main VC instead of calling callback and etc.
